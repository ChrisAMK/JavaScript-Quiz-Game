# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this Project we were to build a Javascript quiz game to check compare our knowledge against others in the class, it was to be displayed on a HTML Page, styled with CSS and given functionality through JavaScript. For my quiz i wanted to have a quiz where the user could select the button and then click to the next question, upon reading the read me just then i realized it was a fatal error. It still works but it isn't what is asked for, the thing i most liked about my quiz are the shuffled questions so every time the quiz starts it is in a random order. im happy with out the quiz works apart from saving the highscores to the Local Storage, i couldn't get multiple key values to stay. i know i got it to work in class but i couldn't figure out where i went wrong here. i think i made this quiz a bit more complicated than it should of been, but i had fun learning a whole bunch of things in the process. I don't know why i didn't read the Acceptance Criteria, won't make that mistake again.
